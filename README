RTracker is a ruby-based BitTorrent tracker, meant to be used with What.CD's Gazelle (it's dependent on it's database schema), although it can easily be adapted for any sourcecode.

To install, make sure you have
1) Ruby (I use 1.8.6, although any version should do)
2) Rubygems
   -- MySQL gem
   -- bencode gem
   -- sinatra gem
3) A properly filled out config.yml file

To start the tracker, simple run
`ruby tracker.rb [-p port] [-e environment]`
where values in braces are optional, port is the port to run on (defaults to 4567) and environment is either production or development (defaults to development).
